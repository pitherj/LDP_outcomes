## Description / abstract

Despite a growing awareness of low transparency and replicability of research across many scientific disciplines, practices that enhance good research conduct – such as pre-registration and sharing of code and non-sensitive data – remain rare. Insufficient access to suitable training has long been identified as a key barrier. The Living Data Project (LDP), an initiative of the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution funded through Canada’s NSERC CREATE program between 2020 and 2026, aims to address this shortfall for graduate students in ecology, evolution, and environmental science across Canada.

The LDP has been unique in offering formal graduate courses to enhance research transparency and replicability, each year providing four 1-credit, synchronous, online modules, each comprising eight 90-minute sessions. Two of these modules focused specifically on training students in the principles and practices of open science, including pre-registrations, sharing code, and following principles for open data discovery and utility (FAIR, doi.org/10.1038%2FSDATA.2016.18). The two other modules addressed complementary skills in synthesis statistics and scientific collaboration. This structured learning environment with peer engagement and interactive discussions provided learning opportunities not covered by existing courses or by self-directed materials, and fostered the building of professional networks in which open science practices became normalized. 

To evaluate whether the training provided by the LDP has made a difference, we will conduct a quasi-experimental, matched-groups study, comparing open science indicators (OSIs) in research outputs from students who completed the LDP courses with those from students who did not receive LDP training; the latter matched by institutions, programs, and graduating years. The OSIs include the posting of pre-prints, and the sharing research data, code, protocols, and study registrations (or pre-registration). We will quantify the OSIs among published outputs using established protocols from the Public Library of Science OSI initiative (doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21640889). We will pre-register our study, and will focus on the first three cohorts of LDP graduates (2020-2022), as these are likely to have had time to yield a sufficient sample size of research outputs. This study will provide a valuable assessment of the real-world impact of structured training in open science.
